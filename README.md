# Work-Scheduler

## Overview

I developed a website that allows you to create a task for a specific time, and save that task to revisit whenever you reload the page

## Content

Depending on the time of day, the textarea will change colour, grey for past, red for present, and green for future. Using localStorage I made the page able to save whatever text you write in the textbox to the webpage after clicking the 'Save' button.
